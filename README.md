Beginner project creating adoption website


### About this project
This project was inspired by countless hours spent browsing adoption websites.

* Uses the PetFinder API to get and display a random adoptable pet.
* Users may filter their search by pet type.
* Users can cycle through the adoptable pets displayed during the current session.

Note: The _pig_ pet type is currently under construction.
